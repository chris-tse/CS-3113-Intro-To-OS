# Project 1a: Roll Your Own Shell

This is the start of a larger project. We start off with creating a simple shell that reads in the following commands:

- `clr` - clear the screen
- `dir <directory>` - list the current directory contents
- `environ` - list all environment strings
- `quit` - exits the program
