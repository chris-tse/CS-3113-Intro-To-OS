AMADEUS Shell v0.3.0

DESCRIPTION
        This is a C shell that mimics features from the popular bash shell,
        including the ability to execute batch files, redirect IO, and will
        fall back to the underlying system shell in the case where it does
        not recognize a command.

INSTALLATION
        To compile this shell use make with the accompanied makefile

        $ make

        To run the shell, execute the compiled binary

        $ ./1c

        To run the shell with a batch file, include the file name as a command
        line argument to the binary

        $ ./1c batchfile

COMMANDS
        help - displays a readme with commands and usage help

        clr - clears the screen

        dir - prints the current directory

        dir <directory> - lists the contents of specified directory. If no
                        directory is given this command prints the contents
                        of the current directory

        cd <directory> - navigates to the specified directory. If no directory
                        is given, this command prints the current working
                        directory

        environ - prints out the current environment variables

        echo <text> - prints out the given text onto the screen

        pause - displays the text "Press Enter to continue..." and waits for
                user to press Enter before continuing execution

        quit - exits the shell

BACKGROUND EXECUTION
        A process can be executed in the background using the & operator.
        Instead of waiting for execution of current command to finish before
        returning to prompt, it immediately returns to prompt without execution
        finishing.

        Example:

            amadeus> sleep 2 &
            amadeus>       // returns to shell without waiting for sleep to end

INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTION
        These operators change the behaviour of the input and output of the
        shell.
    Input Redirection
        To redirect input from a file use the < operator.

        Example:

            amadeus> cat < greetings.txt
            Welcome user

    Output Redirection (Overwrite)
        To redirect output and overwrite contents at destination file use the >
        operator.

        Example:

            amadeus> cat textfile
            This is some text
            amadeus> dir > textfile
            amadeus> cat textfile
            total 136
            drwxr-xr-x  14 christophertse  staff    476 Nov 27 23:17 .
            drwxr-xr-x  12 christophertse  staff    408 Nov 16 14:26 ..
            ... // rest of dir output

    Output Redirection (Append)
        To redirect output and append to the destination file use the >>
        operator.

        Example:

            amadeus> cat greetings.txt
            Welcome user
            amadeus> cat greetings.txt >> newgreet
            amadeus> cat greetings.txt >> newgreet
            amadeus> cat newgreet
            Welcome user
            Welcome user

        Note that the echo command in the current implementation of the
        AMADEUS shell does not redirect output, and will instead print the
        operator to the screen as text.
