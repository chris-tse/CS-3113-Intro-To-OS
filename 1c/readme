AMADEUS Shell v0.3.0

INSTALLATION
    To compile this shell use make with the accompanied makefile

    $ make

    To run the shell, execute the compiled binary

    $ ./1c

DESCRIPTION
    This is a C shell that mimics features from the popular bash shell, including
    the ability to execute batch files, redirect IO, and will fall back to the
    underlying system shell in the case where it does not recognize a command.

COMMANDS
    help - displays a readme with commands and usage help
    clr - clears the screen
    dir - prints the current directory
    dir <directory> - lists the contents of specified directory. If no
                        directory is given this command prints the contents
                        of the current directory
    cd <directory> - navigates to the specified directory. If no directory
                       is given, this command prints the current working
                       directory
    environ - prints out the current environment variables
    echo <text> - prints out the given text onto the screen
    pause - displays the text "Press Enter to continue..." and waits for user
              to press Enter before continuing
              execution
    quit - exits the shell
